# BuddyVibes

The next great looking BuddyPress Block Theme!

This Block Theme is a WIP & needs the BuddyPress **development** version ([GIT](https://github.com/buddypress/buddypress) or [SVN](https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/)) and will be used to create BP Theme Blocks (see `./assets/blocks`).

The goal is to make it available from the [WordPress Theme directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/) a bit before BuddyPress next major version (14.0.0) will be released.

Thanks to this theme, we should be able to:

- display WP regular content with some community vibes.
- build needed APIs to customize BP Block Templates/Parts directly from the WP Site Editor.
- finally renew the BuddyPress.org look and feel.

About interactivity: let's build it with the [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) plugin's active to start enjoying the next [WP Interactivity API](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-interactivity/) & gracefully degrade the user experience using a __no-js__ way to interact with BuddyPress when the WP Interactivity API is not available.
